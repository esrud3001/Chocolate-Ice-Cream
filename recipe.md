1) The first step is to pour the 2 cups of heavy cream into a bowl.
2) Then you have to mix the heavy cream using a whisk and doing it by hand or by a mixer until there are stiff peaks. The heavy cream should not be liquid it should look like whipped cream.
3)Add in the 2 cups of sweetened condensed milk to the bowl and mix together with the heavy cream but not for a long time only till it mixes in with the heavy cream.
4) The second to last step is to add in the 1/2 cup of cooking powder into the bowl. and mix it well using a spatula or a spoon. (You may taste to see if the ice cream needs more coco powder for chocolate taste but that depends on you.)
5) Finally the last step is to freeze the ice cream overnight or for atleast 9 hours.
6) There you have your delicious and yummy, Chocolate Ice Cream.
